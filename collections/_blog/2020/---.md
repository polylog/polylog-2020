description: The moment I fell in love with front-end development was when I
  discovered the style.css file in WordPress themes. That’s where all the magic
  was (is!) to me. I could (can!) change a handful of lines in there and totally
  change the look and feel of a website. It’s an incredible game to play.

That was well before anybody paid me money to be a front-end developer, but even then I felt the intoxicating mix of stimuli that the job offers. Front-end development is this expressive art form, but often constrained by things like the need to directly communicate messaging and accomplish business goals.

Front-end development is at the intersection of art and logic. A cross of business and expression. Both left and right brain. A cocktail of design and nerdery.

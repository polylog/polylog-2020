  <p>On the first day of the forum, it was attended by Sergei Sobyanin, Moscow Mayor, Sergei Kapkov, Head of the Moscow Department of Culture, Mikhail Shvydkoy, Special Presidential Envoy for International Cultural Cooperation. Before the opening ceremony, during the excursion of the Manege's halls, the honorable guests spent some time in the kid zone where KidBurg's young doctors managed to perform a quick medical examination of Sergei Sobyanin.</p>
  <p>Anna Shchyogol, Marketing and PR Director of KidBurg, delivered a speech at the "Ideas and Projects" stage on October 18. Anna told the audience about the forthcoming opening of KidBurg in Moscow and about the new format of family entertainment — edutainment centers. Following Anna's address, the attendees had a good time solving complicated mathematical problems through a game together with a professional actor of KidBurg Children's Careers Town.</p>

<p>KidBurg's kid zone was active on October 15 and 17. Children could learn about the careers of a doctor, a sailor, and a farmer at exciting workshops: They learned how to tell edible mushrooms from poisonous ones, tried to perform medical examinations of the forum's guests, successfully fished for trout, and greeted everyone using the Morse flag semaphore. Upon completion of their studies, the kids received a KidBurg passport and their first game money — "profs", and their parents received a discount coupon to visit the Children's Careers Town after it opens in Moscow. More than 50 kids became the citizens of KidBurg in the total 5 hours of the forum's duration.</p>

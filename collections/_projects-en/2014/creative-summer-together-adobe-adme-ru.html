  <p>A user called Vadim, who dedicated his work to Adobe's masterpiece, 'content aware fill' function (Shift+F5 keys combination), became a winner according to Adme.ru. An awardee selected KupiVIP.ru shopping club is a user called Maxim, who presented a series of prints that looked as if they were painted in water color, but in reality were created using Adobe Photoshop. A winner selected by Adobe Systems experts is Julia Sokolova. Her blazing and snappy prints, stickers, and patterns perfectly fit both gadget cases and apparel. The work uses vector graphics created in Adobe Illustrator. Adobe Systems experts additionally noted a complex and exciting work by Ruslan Jabrailov made at a high technical level.</p>

<p>’The soirée turned out to be incredibly hearty and atmospheric, imbued with a spirit of the old Moscow that inspired and continues to inspire poets and artists,’ says Vadim Samorodov, Head of Senior Generation at Timchenko Foundation. ’We succeeded in showing the guests and participants the importance of the connection between generations and how easy it actually is to speak the same language with people of different age groups. This is because there is always some common ground, literature, art, love to the city or simply a need to express oneself and be heard. We hope that such literary soirées will become a good tradition.’</p>
<p>Polylog Consulting Group has been a partner of Elena and Gennady Timchenko Charitable Foundation for more than a year organizing and providing PR support to projects aimed at solving social problems in Russia, including Senior Generation project. Moscow through Poetry and Prose" literary soirée became another project with a purpose to expand the concept of age in public conscience and promote the "society for all age groups" — a comfortable social environment for senior citizens.</p>

      <p>Russia has to secure a niche for itself in the global market of liquefied natural gas (LNG) before 2020. Otherwise the niche will be occupied by competitors from Australia and the Middle East, where a lot of gas liquefaction facilities are being constructed. This was declared by Alexander Khoroshavin, the Governor of Sakhalin, during 21st World Petroleum Congress in Moscow.</p>

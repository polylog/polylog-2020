<p class="lead">Technodoctrine 2014, Russia's first forum of technological leadership, was held on November 6-7 in Moscow, in the InfoSpace event hall. The event was organized with the support of the Military-Industrial Commission of the Russian Federation, Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation, Voluntary Association for Assistance to Army, Air Force and Navy of Russia, Federation Council, and the Russian Union of Scientific and Engineering Associations.</p>
<p>The team of Polylog Consulting Group acted as a partner and operator of the Forum. The company's specialists provided organizational, informational, and logistical support for the event.</p>
<p>Technodoctrine 2014, Russian forum of technological leadership, became a unique platform for the engineering-related large-scale discussion of the goals, priorities, principles of technological development of Russia, as well as for professional dialogue between large industrial enterprises and young talents.</p>
<p>One of the important outcomes of the event was the creation of the Union of Young Engineers of Russia. The presidium of the constituent congress included Oleg Bochkarev, deputy chairman of the board of the Military-Industrial Commission of the Russian Federation; Mikhail Remizov, president of National Strategy Institute, Alexei Zharich, deputy director of Uralvagonzavod Corporation; Igor Lobovsky, president of Global Energy, non-commercial partnership for development of the international research and projects in the field of energetics; Sergey Maev, chairman of Voluntary Association for Assistance to Army, Air Force and Navy of Russia, and others. During the Forum, the participants approved the Charter of the Union, elected the management bodies, and made a resolution on the establishment of regional divisions based on technical associations of youth and technical universities.</p>
<p>One of the most popular events of the forum was the foresight session called “Development of the Key Parameters of the Doctrine of Scientific and Technological Development of Russia” led by Stanislav Taktaev, the head of “Tekhnoprognoz − Open Future” online expert analysis system. The participants of the foresight project were asked to model the future with due account for the trends of the present and create roadmaps for the main directions of the engineering progress: defense industry, space industry, and civil instrument engineering.</p>

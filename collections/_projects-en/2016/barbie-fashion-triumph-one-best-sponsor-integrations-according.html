  <p>In order to increase brand’s visibility and public awareness and to ensure loyalty of the Russian media and consumers Polylog Consulting Group suggested the fashion format of the brand integration.</p>
  <p>The Alena Akhmadullina sponsorship integration was a logical continuation of the previous collaborations with Russian designers Igor Chapurin and Dasha Gauser which were also executed by the Polylog Consulting Group. Capsule collection „Alena Akhmadullina for Barbie” presented at the Mercedes-Benz Fashion week became a brand integration product. 35 looks with unique floral prints were demonstrated by professional models of different appearances and ages. Children of famous celebrities took part in the fashion show as models as well. Many celebrities and media people were invited to the show to witness the masterpiece.</p>

  <h2>How could just a doll take the 2<sup>nd</sup> place in the „Best creative sponsorship integration”?</h2>
  <div>
    <p>The judgement within the framework of the awards was based not on the sponsoring volume but on the creativity of the native integration.</p>
    <p>Alena Akhmadullina didn’t just create a doll collection that ground out pink dresses for young women but she breathed haute couture into girlish silhouettes and tender color layout. The mission of the agency was to search for an optimal solution for brand collaboration which would be creative and unique. The promotion of the Barbie brand was not limited by the concept of the capsule collection but was additionally realized by the venue branding. The back of the catwalk was executed in the form of the Barbie package. As a result every guest of the show could recognize the famous doll brand that forms fashion tastes of the younger generation at the most fashionable event of the year.</p>

<p>For that presentation arrived a special guest, famous master of style from Holland and artistic director of the Philips HairCare Andy Uffels. He created six fashionable and impressive hairstyles that reflect his point of view on actual trends in hairstyle fashion, make-up and clothes this summer. </p>
<p>At the presentation there attended representatives of more than 50 magazines, such as Vogue, GQ, Elle, HairStyle, Gloria and some others.</p>
<p>During the presentations journalists have seen a maser-class in hairstyling using Philips gadgets. Everyone could take part in that master-class — as a model, or as a master of style. There were also a special session on the topic of body-care stuff: epilators, bikini-trimmers, home solaria.</p>

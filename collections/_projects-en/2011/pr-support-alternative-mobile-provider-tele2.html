<p class="lead">“Polylog” CG provided PR support for an alternative mobile provider “Tele2” entering the retail market of Moscow.</p>
<p>In March 2011 the Swedish company “Tele2” chose “Polylog” CG as its preferred bidder for the provision of PR-services to promote the “Call Cheaper” new tariff plan.</p>
<p>The “Call Cheaper” tariff is especially in demand in the summer season and is particularly appealing to Muscovites spending their time in the countryside in the Moscow regions adjacent to the Central Federal District. That is why an outdoor restaurant “Royal Bar” located on the bank of the river was selected as the venue for a press conference in the style of the “first picnic of the season”. President of “Tele2 Russia” Dmitry Strashnov and Commercial Director Inessa Galaktionova presented a new product to the journalists of business and specialized media. </p>
<p>The “Call Cheaper” tariff can be connected free-of-charge. Calls to any Moscow number will cost 1.5 rubles per minute on the second-rounding basis. SMS and each megabyte of Web traffic will cost1.5 rubles.</p>

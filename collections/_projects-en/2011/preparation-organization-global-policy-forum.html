  <blockquote>
    <p>The organization of the Forum was fantastic. It was really well organized, everything went smoothly. The students who helped in organization were great; they were extremely professional, friendly and enthusiastic. I thought that in England you would not find such helpful students, they would not be even there on time! In England the students always show up late, I don’t want to generalize but usually it is like this. Those young people in blue uniforms were absolute stars – smiling, professional, helpful all the time. And this was really fantastic. So, organization I think was simply great. I don’t think you could have improved it, it was a hundred percent. </p>
    <p>So I think the forum should continue but you should make it a bit more interactive. I think it has established its own identity. The Global Policy Forum is obviously smaller than Davos which makes it more interesting in my opinion.</p>

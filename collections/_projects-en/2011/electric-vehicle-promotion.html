<p class="lead">“Polylog” Consulting Group has provided Media support for signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on collaboration to promote electric vehicles and improve the natural environment of the Kaluga region. The event was covered by federal editions, Kaluga’s leading business Media and television.</p>
<p>On August 27, 2011 Mitsubishi Motors Corporation (MMC), Rolf Import, MMC’s exclusive distributor in the Russian market, the Government of the Kaluga Region and the Municipal Administration signed a Memorandum of Understanding to promote electric vehicles and improve the environment of the Kaluga region. The Memorandum implies exchange of information among three parties on the development of electric vehicles (EV) and good infrastructure. According to this document, MMC, Rolf Import and the Government of the Kaluga Region will jointly work to reduce emissions of CO2, as well as improve energy efficiency in the region. The President of MMC Osamu Masuko, ROLF Import CEO Andrey Pankov and the Governor of the Kaluga region Anatoly Artamonov have signed the document in Kaluga. Thus, the parties have already begun their cooperative actions promoting electric vehicles and improving the environmental conditions in the Kaluga region, where a car assembly plant is located. </p>
<p>It should be reminded that ROLF Import was among the first distributors of foreign automobile brands that started limited test-market sales of the first serial electric vehicle Mitsubishi i-MiEV. The car is equipped with a 64-hp electric motor; it has a cruising range of 150 km and a top speed of 130 km per hour. MMC has already signed more than 30 similar agreements with the governmental authorities of different countries and regions, as well as with private and public organizations aiming to better the environment through the promotion of EVs and EV infrastructure development. These agreements are designed to help reduce CO2 emissions and optimize energy consumption. Today MMC and its strategic partner, ROLF Import, work in close collaboration with local authorities in the Kaluga region in order to implement such programs throughout Russia in the near future.</p>

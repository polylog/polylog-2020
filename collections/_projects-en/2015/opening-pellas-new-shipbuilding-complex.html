  <h3>Brief Description</h3>
  <p>The new dock yard occupies only 20 hectares, but it can build up to four vessels simultaneously (there is also an additional hull preparation shop at the factory). The main idea of the project is to create a compact assembly-flow production of modern marine vessels. There are no counterparts to the plant in Russia.</p>

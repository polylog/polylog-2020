<p>Polylog Consulting Group acted as the technical operator of the forum and was responsible for the following tasks: development of the event venue, accreditation of mass media and participants, interaction with speakers and guests of the forum, creation and maintenance of the website, security, catering, subcontractor management and interaction with journalists at the event venue. </p>
<p>Polylog also designed and created the international Media Center for mass media, ensured intense interaction of the forum's speakers with journalists, and organized activities of the mobile Press Center during the forum. </p>

  <h2>100 days before the forum</h2>
  <img src="{{ site.assets }}/img/clients/eef/2015-10-07-13.jpg" alt="the first Eastern Economic Forum (EEF)" style="clip: rect(auto, auto, 418px, auto);">
  <p>The decision to involve Polylog Consulting Group in the organization of the first Eastern Economic Forum was made on 30 May 2015 following the open tender, where 14 leading specialized companies participated. Polylog Consulting Group's bid was recognized as best meeting the requirements of the tender organizer due to an elaborate business offer and significant experience in holding large-scale events at the international level.</p>
  <p>The first Eastern Economic Forum was prepared in a very short time: the order of the President of the Russian Federation on the holding of Eastern Economic Forum was signed at the end of May 2015, a mere 3 months before the date of the event. At this time, the schedules of key investors and business representatives had already been made, and convincing them to visit this event became one of the biggest challenges for organizers.</p>

  <p>Eastern Economic Forum was assisted by 419 volunteers who helped the guests of EEF in the territory of the FEFU, at hotels and in the airport 8-12 hours every day. </p>
  <p>Key business events of the forum were translated into 5 languages: English, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Russian.

<p>Security for forum participants was ensured by 1,000 special security officers. The challenge faced by the organizers was that the academic process didn't stop on campus during the event, and there were 8,000 students and faculty of the FEFU on campus in addition to participants of the forum. </p>
<p>The following corporations acted as the Forum's title partners: Alrosa, Mazda Motor Rus, Vneshekonombank, Gazprom, Norilsk Nickel, Polyus, Rosneft Oil and Gas Company, Federal Hydro-Generating Company RusHydro, and Fesco transportation group.

<p class="lead">In December 2014, Polylog Agency assisted in opening of KidBurg's children's tent on Tsvetnoy Boulevard as part of the municipal Best Winter City Festival.</p>
<p>Moscow's Department of Culture and KidBurg Children's Careers Town joined their efforts to erect a separate roofed and heated zone for children during the winter festival in Moscow for the first time ever.</p>
<p>The interactive program of the festival was developed by KidBurg Children's Careers Town, a popular St. Petersburg project scheduled to open in Moscow in the iconic Central Children's Store (former Detskiy Mir) on Lubyanka.</p>

  <h2>2,000 Children</h2>
  <p>During the whole duration of New Year holidays, the young Muscovites could take a dive into a fairy-tale atmosphere and get excellent New Year presents. Anyone willing could give a helping hand to Santa! One had to cope with the tests prepared by mischievous gnomes: Have a snow fight with them, repair the railroad, defeat the gnomes in the Rolling Hockey game, and outdance them. More than 2,000 children participated in the entertainment program.</p>
  <p>In addition to the New Year adventure game, the kids and their parents were given an opportunity to win a ticket to Moscow's KidBurg and make a photo together.</p>

<p class="lead">On June, 15 Stephen Harvey, Senior Mechanical Design and Innovation Manager at Logitech, gave his lecture at MOD Design Centre. It was followed by a workshop. Polylog Company organized the event and invited the journalists. There were about 50 representatives of mass media with a focus on IT, LS and design.</p>
<p>In his report Stephen talked about the principles of management and the process of mechanical design in the company: from the first test samples to the final product. Taking Logitech Touch Mouse M600 as an example, Stephen showed the guests all development phases of the device: prototyping, design of functional and technical characteristics, usability testing and quality.</p>
<p>After Stephen’s lecture, the guests were invited to participate in a workshop and create their own design of computer peripherals using bright acrylic paints on huge 50-centimeter models of computer mice.</p>

<p class="lead">The grand opening of the Imperial Porcelain Factory’s flagship store located in Kutuzovsky Avenue was held on March 6, 2012. Polylog Consulting Group provided organizational and press support.</p>
<p>The new store with an area of 600 m² has become the largest and most sophisticated one in the IPF corporate chain. A well-known designer Edward Zabuga has been working on the interior of this “porcelain boutique”. The new store is divided into several areas: retail space, designed in laconic style and neutral colors; VIP-room designed in classic style with unconventional accents and made of dark wood; the Gallery of contemporary porcelain art.</p>
<p>The Gallery is a unique space which houses exclusive IPF works of art and replicas of famous imperial vases, sculptures and table sets from the collections of the Hermitage and other leading national museums. Exhibitions, presentations and porcelain painting workshops are expected to be held there.</p>
<p>There is a wide variety of the Imperial Porcelain Factory’s products in the store from classic and ever-popular bone china dinner sets, mug and saucer sets to the items based on the sketches of contemporary IPF artists and characterized by sophisticated figurative and stylistic design.</p>
<p>Tatiana Chapurgina’s unique Porcelain Dresses Show was held as part of the opening ceremony. For the first time ever the collection of dresses, embroidered in porcelain was presented to the Moscow public.</p>
<p>“The store in Kutuzovsky, 17” is the Imperial Porcelain Factory’s flagship chain store. There are already 18 stores in Moscow and St. Petersburg and more than 60 stores of partners and distributors in Russia and abroad. “This store has become a real pearl in our collection,” said General Director of the Imperial Porcelain Factory Tatiana Tylevich.</p>
<p>The new store contains the items of the Imperial Porcelain Factory’s French partner, namely Deshoulieres Group. It is one of the oldest of porcelain manufacturers which carefully preserves and develops the best traditions of table setting, elements of the French “art de vivre” recognized as part of the world's cultural heritage by UNESCO.</p>

<p class="lead">The presentation of the tea-set “Mess room” was held on February 13, 2012. It was the result of creative cooperation of Yevgeny Grishkovets, a well-known contemporary writer, playwright, director and artist and Vera Bakastova, an artist of the Imperial Porcelain Factory. Polylog Consulting Group provided event and press support. The representatives from the most reputable interior design and culinary periodicals, radio and television attended the presentation.</p>
<p>At a press conference Yevgeny Grishkovets told the reporters about the idea of painting the tea-set and developing a nautical theme. It was not chosen by chance as the writer himself once served in the Navy. His voiced images and symbols were transmitted on to china and objects in the “Armorial” form which was produced in the Imperial Porcelain Factory in the second half of XIX century. The tea-set turned out to be mellow in color, compositionally verified and complete.</p>
<p>Collaboration with famous people is a historically-developed tradition for the Imperial Porcelain Factory. “The priority area of the factory development is bright creative projects, fresh ideas and new products. “We strive for cooperation with talented representatives of culture and arts and we are ready to create all conditions for favorable and efficient cooperation”, said Tatiana Tylevich, Director General of the Imperial Porcelain Factory. “This event is of equal importance for me as well as the arrival of my new book in the bookstores”, pointed out Yevgeny Grishkovets.</p>
<p>URALSIB Financial Corporation was the Event Partner.</p>

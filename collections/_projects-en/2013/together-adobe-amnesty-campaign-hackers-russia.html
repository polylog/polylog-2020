<p class="lead">In August Adobe Systems Inc. conducted amnesty for computer pirates — a campaign aimed at preventing intellectual piracy in Russia. That month the corporation did not initiate verification of end-users of unlicensed software which was copyrighted by Adobe. At the same time there were held workshops, free consultations and training sessions for those who want to legalize and purchase the software. Information support to the campaign was provided by “Polylog” consulting group.</p>

<p>In addition, Adobe software users could purchase subscription to Creative Cloud with discounts up to 40 %.</p>
<p>At the start of the campaign, the “Polylog” CG organized a press briefing where the Head of Adobe Systems Department of Anti -intellectual piracy in Russia and in CIS countries Igor Slabykh announced the act of pardon for users of unlicensed software in the Russian Federation. </p>
<p>The amnesty coincided with the entry into force of the “anti-piracy” law in Russia, so the press conference attracted a lot of attention in the federal mass media and in specialized IT— publications.</p>

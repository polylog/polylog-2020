  <p>Deputy Minister for Communications and Mass Media Mark Shmulevich, who worked together with experts from Russian StartUp Tour at the sites of the Russian cities, says that “Russian StartUp Tour has given a new impetus to the development of entrepreneurship in all technological areas in Russia. Promoting entrepreneurship in high-tech fields, especially in the field of IT, - is an extremely important area for the state. We need to involve as many young people as possible in the process of creating high-tech businesses. It is important to give young people an understanding of their opportunities at the initial stage of choosing their career. And the Russian StartUp Tour, of course, fit into this concept. However, it should be only one of a series of events that will engage young people in the development and commercialization of innovations”.</p>

<p>Summing up the results of the project, the headliner of the Russian StartUp Tour, Advisor to the President of the “Skolkovo” Fund Pekka Viljakainen noted how much things had changed in the Russian regions in the five years since he first had started working with Russian startups: “There was not a city that would not surprise us by anything – wonderful projects, active startup community, a strong academic base and infrastructure. But most importantly – the interest in innovations increased among young people. In each city, we were met by full halls of young entrepreneurs, we have given more than 150 interviews and commentaries to regional journalists, we have answered more than 400 questions from the audience, and all of these issues have been practical, professional, aimed at a particular result. We could feel the motivation of people to shape their own future, regardless of where they live, and initial conditions”.</p>

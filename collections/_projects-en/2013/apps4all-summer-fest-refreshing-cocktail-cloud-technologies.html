<p>“The largest number of participants gathered the section “Prospects for cooperation of mobile operators and developers” — the joint session of Huawei and MegaLabs; it was attended by representatives of the “Big Three”. We even had to extend the debate timing— the developers had a lot of questions for the largest Russian mobile operators. In my opinion, the most important outcome of this debate — is the “Big Three” feedback to the participants of the market of mobile applications, which expressed the readiness of mobile operators to review and analyze investment ideas of developers”— said Zamir Shukhov, the Head of the Event department, “Polylog” CG.</p>

    <p>At Convention plenary sessions and meetings the participants together with the experts identified current trends of science and technology world, discussed the specifics of translation of discoveries in fundamental and applied sciences, the possibilities of new biomedical technologies and robotics. </p>
    <p>The discussions were attended by the Head of the Federal Agency for Youth Affairs Sergey Belokonev, by Igor Agamirzyan (JSC “RVC”), Mark Bunger (Lux Research, USA), Sergey Chvalun (Kurchatov Institute), Dmitry Ovchinnikov (“SELECTA RUS”), Aleksander Poletaev (IIR “Immunkulus”), Nigel Ackland (UK), Vladimir Beliy (Alpha Smart Systems), Giorgio Metta (iCub, Italy), Francesco Ferro (PAL Robotics, Spain), Christian Gorret (Vive Les Robots!, Denmark), Al and Laura Ries (USA) and many others.</p>
    <p>The key element of the 2013 Convention was the unusual format of presentation of scientific and technical knowledge. The participants of the innovation projects exhibition presented prototypes and production models of high-tech products of young inventors. All day long the “ArtScience” project was surprising the participants by spectacular scientific experiments at the site of the Convention. Game Watchers of the MSU Interactive education studios supervised the course of the interactive game “Orbit”, the winners of which received awards and prizes at the end of the day.</p>
    <p>“This year at the Convention we, as event organizers, “discovered” a new format – “scientific fights”. The first “scientific fights” were held in 2010 in Berlin, and then they spread to other European countries. StandUp Science or Science Slam- is a new form of popularization of science, when the author of the research for few minutes in a creative and understandable form describes his\her discovery. The “scientific fights” appeared as one of the most popular sections at the Concention, and we plan to use this format in the framework of our other activities”- said the business director of “Polylog” CG Artem Borovoy.</p>
